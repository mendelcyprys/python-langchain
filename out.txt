2 Abstract  34 
At over 200 years, the maximum lifespan of the bowhead whale exceeds that of all 35 
other mammals . The bowhead is also the second- largest animal on Earth, reaching 36 
over 80,000 kg1. In spite of its very large number of cells, the bowhead is not highly  37 
cancer -prone, an incongruity termed  Peto’s Paradox2. This has been explained by the 38 
evolution  of additional tumor suppressor genes in larger animals , which is supported by 39 
research on elephants  demonstrating expansion of the p53 gene3–5. However, we show  40 
here that bowhead whale  fibroblasts  under go oncogenic transformation after disruption 41 
of fewer tumor suppressors  than required for  human fibroblasts.  Instead, analysis of 42 
DNA repair  revealed that bowhead cells repair double- strand breaks with uniquely high 43 
efficiency and accuracy compared to other mammals. Further, we identified two 44 
proteins, CIRBP and RPA2, that are present at high levels in bowhead fibroblasts and 45 
increase the efficiency and fidelity of D NA repair in human cells. These results suggest 46 
that rather than possessing additional tumor suppressor genes as barriers to 47 
oncogenesis, the bowhead whale relies on more accurate and efficient DNA repair to 48 
preserve genome integrit y. This strategy that does not eliminate cells but repairs them  49 
may be critical for the long and cancer -free lifespan of the bowhead whale.  Our work 50 
demonstrates the value  of studying long- lived organisms in  identify ing novel longevity 51 
mechanisms and their potential for translation to humans.  52

Introduction 55 
The Alaskan Iñupiat  Inuit, who carry on a long tradition of subsistence hunting of the 56 
bowhead whale ( Balaena mysticetus ), maintain that these animals “live two human 57 
lifetimes ”6. Remarkably, a series  of bowhead whales captured in the late- twen tieth and 58 
early -twenty -first centur ies lent new  credence to these claims, as embedded in their 59 
bodies were traditional stone harpoon points and bomb lance fragments dating to the 60 
Victorian era7. Subsequent scientific study and age estimation through quantification of 61 .

3 ovarian corpora, baleen dating, and eye lens aspartic acid racemization analysis 62 
supported a maximum lifesp an exceeding 200 years in the bowhead whale7–12. Thus, 63 
the range of mammalian lifespans covers  roughly 2 orders of magnitude, with the model 64 
organism Mus musculus living for 2 -3 years while the bowhead whale lives  100 times as 65 
long.  66 
An increased number of cells and cell divisions in larger organisms might be expected 67 
to contribute to increased cancer incidence and shorter lifespans. The apparent 68 
contradiction between expected and observed cancer rates in relation to species body 69 
mass has been noted for decades and is known as Peto’s Paradox.2,13– 15 It is theorized 70 
to result from compensatory evolutionary adaptations driven by reduced extrinsic 71 
mortality in larger species2. The bowhead whale exceeds 80,000 kg in mass and 200 72 
years in lifespan. Both of these factors predispose it to accumulating lar ge numbers of 73 
DNA mutations  throughout life. To remain alive for so long it must possess uniquely 74 
potent genetic mechanisms to prevent cancer and other age- related diseases. 75 
However, primary research publications on genetic  and molecular mechanisms of aging 76 
in the bowhead whale are scarce, consisting primarily of genome and transcriptome 77 
analysis16–18.  78 
The multi -stage model of carcinogenesis posits that the transition from a normal cell to a 79 
cancer cell involves multiple distinct genetic “hits,” or mutat ions19. Larger and longer - 80 
living species might require greater numbers of “hits” for oncogenic transformation, 81 
given their greater cell number and increased lifespan. Indeed, there is experimental 82 
evidence to support this hypothesis. Rangarajan et al. found that while mouse 83 
fibroblasts require perturbation of 2 pathways for tumorigenic transformation (p53 and 84 .

4 Ras), human  fibroblasts require 5 hits (p53, pRb, PP2A, telomerase and Ras)20. A 85 
human should thus have a dramatically lower per -cell incidence of malignant 86 
transformation than a mouse, and can maintain a larger number of cells for a longer 87 
period of time.  88 
Species that are larger and longer -lived than humans may be expected to have even 89 
more layers of protection against oncogenic transformation than humans and common 90 
model species. In support of this hypothesis, recent studies have identified copy number 91 
expansion and functional diversification of multiple tumor suppressor genes, such as 92 
TP53 and LIF, in elephants  and other taxa3,5,21– 23. These studies  identified multiple  93 
copies of TP53  in the elephant genome, several of which were confirmed to be 94 
transcribed and translated in elephant fibroblasts and contributed to an enhanced 95 
apoptotic response to genotoxic stress.  96 
However, additional copies of p53 genes are unlikely to slow down aging. One 97 
promising mechanism that could help explain both cancer  resistance and slower aging 98 
in long- lived mammals is more accurate or efficient DNA repair. Genetic mutations have 99 
been identified as causal factors in carcinogenesis for over a century24. Perhaps one of 100 
the most compelling lines of evidence supporting the role of DNA repair in the 101 
pathogenesis of aging and cancer comes from studies of mutants with accelerated 102 
aging phenotypes. Remarkably, m ost s uch mutants have defects in DNA repair 103 
enzymes25–29. Across species, several studies have also pointed toward improved DNA 104 
repair capacity and reduced mutation accumulation as characteristics associated with 105 
species  longevity30–34. Here, we identify specific cellular and molecular traits 106 
characterizing bowhead cancer resistance and longevity and distinguishing the 107 .

5 bowhead from shorter -lived mammals including humans. We show that bowhead whale 108 
cells are not more prone to apoptosis , and require fewer genetic hits for malignant 109 
transformation than human cells. Instead, the bowhead whale relies on more accurate 110 
and efficient DNA double strand break (DSB) repair mediated by CIRBP and RPA2. 111 
This more “conservative” strategy that does not needlessly eliminate cells but repairs 112 
them  may be critical for the long and cancer -free lifespan of the bowhead whale.  113

Results  115 
Growth characteristics, cellular senescence, and cell death in bowhead whale   116 
Most human somatic cells  lack telomerase activity  and as a result undergo replicative 117 
senescence with serial passaging in culture35. Replicative and stress -induced  118 
senescence are important mechanisms for preventing cancer. Using TRF and TRAP 119 
assays to measure telomere length and telomerase activity, we found that bowhead 120 
whale skin fibroblasts, like human fibroblasts , lack telomerase activity and experience 121 
telomere shortening followed by replicative senescence with passaging in culture 122 
(Figure 1a,  b). In both species, n early all cells stain ed positive for senescence - 123 
associated β-galactosidase upon terminal growth arres t (Figure 1 c, d). As in  human 124 
fibroblasts, stable overexpression  of human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) 125 
to maintain telomere length prevented replicative senescence in bowhead cells (Figure 126 
1a). Senescence can also be induced by DNA damage. Like human cells, bowhead 127 
whale skin fibroblasts efficiently enter ed senescence but did  not significantly induce  cell 128 
death in response to 10 or  20 Gy of γ -irradiation (Figure 1c-e ). 129 .

6 Interestingly, transcriptome analysis of human and bowhead whale senescent 130 
fibroblasts showed reduced induction of senescence -associated secretory phenotype 131 
(SASP) factors in bowhead whale (Figure 1 f) relative to human. Paracrine effects of 132 
SASP on surroun ding cells are thought to  contribute to age- related diseases and 133 
carcinogenesis . These transcriptomic differences may indicate that senescence is able 134 
to preserve its anti -cancer function in the bowhead with reduced harmful paracrine 135 
signaling.  136 
To test whether increased p53 activity could  contribute to cancer resistance in the 137 
bowhead whale, we transiently transfected primary mouse, cow, human and bowhead 138 
whale skin fibroblasts with a luciferase reporter vector containing a p53- response 139 
element. The bowhead whale cells had the lowest p53 activity of the species tested 140 
(Figure  1g). Additionally , we did not observe any differences in the induction of 141 
apoptosis in response to UVC between species (Figure  1h). Together, our results argue 142 
against the idea that increased clearance of damaged cells through apoptosis 143 
contributes to cancer resistance in the bowhead whale .           144 
Requirements for oncogenic transformation of bowhead whale cells  145 
We initially identified a minimal combination of oncogene and tumor suppressor hits 146 
required for in vitro  malignant transformation of bowhead whale skin fibroblasts using 147 
the soft agar assay, which measures anchorage- independent growth, a hallmark of 148 
cancer. While normal cells undergo growth arrest or programmed cell death (anoikis) in 149 
soft agar, malignant ce lls continue to grow without  substrate adhesion and form visible 150 
colonies36. We introduced constructs targeting oncogene and tumor suppressor 151 
pathways into primary skin fibroblasts with PiggyBac (PB) transposon vectors, which 152 .

7 integrate into the genome and drive stable expression. Since bowhead whale primary 153 
fibroblasts, like human fibroblasts, exhibit progressive telomere shortening and lack 154 
telomerase activity (Figure 1 b), we used cell lines expressing ( hTERT ) to bypass 155 
replicative senescence.  156 
In agreement with published findings, transformation of human hTERT + fibroblasts 157 
required combined expression of H -RasG12V, SV40 Large T (LT) antigen (which binds 158 
and inactivates p53 and the Rb family of tumor suppressors), and SV40 Small T (ST) 159 
antigen (which binds and inactivates PP2A)  (Figure 2a)20. Rather than requiring hits to 160 
additional pathways, however, bowhead hTERT + fibroblasts were transformed by H - 161 
RasG12V and SV40 LT alone, suggesting that bowhead cells may require fewer genetic 162 
mutations to become cancerous compared to human cells (Figure 2 a). These findings 163 
were supported by mouse xenograft assays, in which the number of hits needed for 164 
tumor growth matched the findings from soft agar (Figure 2 b). 165 
We next sought to confirm these findings at the genetic level, through CRISPR editing 166 
of individual tumor suppressor genes in bowhead fibroblasts. While the sequenced 167 
bowhead genome has not revealed copy number expansion of canonical tumor 168 
suppressor genes16,17, CRISPR knockout allows for more precise quantification of the 169 
number of genetic mutations required for oncogenesis. While the most important target 170 
of SV40 LT is thought to be Rb ( RB1 gene), it is also known to inactivate p130 and 171 
p107, two additional members of the Rb- family , providing some level of functional 172 
redundancy. Using CRISPR, we were able to introduce targeted mutations into the 173 
bowhead RB1 gene speci fically, along with TP53  (the other target of LT), and PTEN  (an 174 
upstream inhibitor of Akt signaling commonly mutated in human cancers, and operating 175 .

8 in the same pathway as PP2A). Following transfection of hTERT + bowhead fibroblasts 176 
with Cas9 -guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complexes targeting each of the 177 
aforementioned genes, we screened clonally isolated colonies for loss of the targeted 178 
protein by Western blot ( Figure 2c, d , Extended Data Figure 1a,  b). We additionally 179 
screened the colonies with luciferase reporter assays to confirm loss of protein function 180 
and activity ( Extended Data Figure 1c, d ). For each selected clone, we sequenced the 181 
CRISPR- targeted genes to confirm homozygous knockout at the genetic level and 182 
determine the causal mutations  (Supplementary Figure 1,  2). Through this strategy, we 183 
generated single and compound homozygous knockout bowhead whale fibroblasts for 184 
TP53 , RB1, and PTEN . In agreement with our initial findings, genetic inactivation of 185 
TP53  and RB1 in bowhead whale  fibroblasts expressing hTERT  and H -RasG12V was 186 
sufficient  for malignant transformation in both soft agar and mouse xenograft assays 187 
(Figure 2a, b ). These findings suggest  that despite  its large size and long lifespan , the 188 
cells of the bowhead whale unexpectedly require fewer mutational hits for malignant 189 
transformation than human cells.  190 
Excision repair and mutagenesis in the bowhead whale  191 
To understand if improved DNA repair  might reduce cancer risk in the bowhead whale, 192 
we first assessed the efficiency  of nucleotide excision repair ( NER) and base excision 193 
repair ( BER) in bowhead whale cells. NER is primarily responsible for removing helix - 194 
distorting DNA lesions. To quantify NER activity, we utilized a host cell plasmid 195 
reactivation assay and quantitation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers by ELISA to 196 
measure repair of UVC -induced DNA damage. NER efficiency was similar between 197 
bowhead and human ( Extended Data Figure 2a, b). BER is responsible for ameliorating 198 .

9 many types of spontaneous DNA base damage such as oxidation and deamination. The 199 
efficiency of BER, as measured by plasmid reactivation assay, trended toward higher 200 
BER activity in bowhead whale compared to human cells, but this difference was not 201 
statistically significant ( Extended Data Figure 2c). Additionally , bowhead fibroblasts 202 
displayed dramatically higher PARP activity in response to H 2O2 treatment ( Extended 203 
Data Figure 2d, e). PARP proteins play important roles in the DNA damage response 204 
and are recruited to sites of DNA damage where they participate in the DNA damage 205 
response and in repair.   206 
We next compared the point mutation frequency in the bowhead whale and human 207 
using the HPRT mutagenesis assay, which relies on loss of HPRT activity after 208 
mutagen treatment37. The HPRT  gene exists as a single copy on the X chromosome in 209 
male mammalian cells, a feature we found to be true for the bowhead as well ( see 210 
Methods). We treated primary fibroblast lines from male bowhead whale and human  211 
with the potent mutagen and alkylating agent N -ethyl -N-nitrosourea (ENU), and then 212 
plated cells in selective media containing 6- thioguanine, which kills cells with function al 213 
HPRT. Despite a slightly higher sensitivity to ENU in bowhead whale as indicated by 214 
colony -forming efficiency in non- selective media, the rate of HPRT mutant colony 215 
formation was markedly lower in bowhead whale than human fibroblasts, an effect 216 
which re mained significant after adjusting for plating efficiency ( Extended Data Figure 217 
2f, g). This result suggests that bowhead whale has more accurate DNA repair . 218 
High  efficiency and  fidelity of bowhead whale double -strand break repair  219 
DNA DSBs are toxic if not repaired and may lead to mutations through inaccurate 220 
repair. DSB s are repaired by  two major pathways: non- homologous end joining (NHEJ) 221 .

10 and homologous recombination (HR). To assess relative NHEJ efficiency, we integrated 222 
fluorescent GFP-based reporter cassettes 38 into fibroblasts from mouse, cow, human 223 
and bowhead whale . Following DSB  induction with I -SceI, we observed markedly 224 
elevated NHEJ efficiency in bowhead whale relative to other species  (Figure 3a , 225 
Extended Data Figure 3a-c). Additionally, bowhead whale fibroblasts accumulated fewer 226 
micronuclei, a marker of chromosomal instability, after 2Gy γ- irradiation (Figure 3b , 227 
Extended Data Figure 3d ). The kinetics of radiation- induced DSB rejoining as measured 228 
by pulsed- field gel electrophoresis were similar between bowhead and human cells, 229 
with almost all breaks repaired within 48h in both species ( Extended Data Figure  3e, f). 230 
As mutations resulting from inaccurate DSB repair promote cancer development , we 231 
next sought to assess the fidelity of DSB repair in the bowhead whale.  Sequencing and 232 
analysis of repair junctions from integrated NHEJ reporter (Figure 3)  and extra- 233 
chromosomal NHEJ reporter (Extended Data Figure 3a, c) assays showed  higher 234 
fidelity of NHEJ in bowhead whale cells: compared to human, the bowhead whale is 235 
less prone to producing deletions during the repair of incompatible DNA termini and far 236 
more frequently joins ends without deleting any bases beyond the small overhang 237 
region.   238 
We also measured the fidelity of repair at an endogenous genomic locus. Initial 239 
sequencing results from CRISPR tumor suppressor knockout experiments suggested a 240 
strong bias in bowhead whale cells toward DSB repair products with single- base 241 
insertion mutations, in contrast to the greater diversity and size of repair outcomes 242 
commonly observed in human and mouse cells. To systematically compare mutational 243 
outcomes of CRISPR break repair in the bowhead whale to those of humans and 244 .

11 shorter -living mammals, we performed CRISPR transfections in multiple primary 245 
fibroblast lines from bowhead  whale , human, cow, and mouse, and used deep amplicon 246 
sequencing of the targeted locus to generate detailed profiles of repair outcomes. We 247 
took advantage of the fact that exon 1 of the PTEN  tumor suppressor gene is highly 248 
conserved across mammals, w ith 100% sequence identity across included species 249 
(Extended Data Figure 4a). We were therefore able to examine species -specific DSB 250 
repair outcomes at an endogenous genomic locus while minimizing intra-species 251 
variation in the break -proximal sequence context.  252 
Analysis of sequencing data revealed species -specific repair outcomes, which were 253 
consiste nt across cell lines derived from multiple animals of each species (Figure 3d-f ). 254 
In human, cow, and mouse, the most common mutational outcomes  were deletions. In 255 
contrast, the bowhead was the only species that preferentially repaired breaks with a 256 
single -base insertion. The frequency of unmodified alleles, which are known to occur 257 
after error -free repair of CRISPR DSBs39,40, was the highest  in bowhead whale (Figure 258 
3e). No insertions or deletions were detected in untreated control samples  (Extended 259 
Data  Figure 4b). As analysis of CRISPR RNP transfection efficiency by flow cytometry 260 
and cleavage efficiency by digital droplet PCR showed similar CRISPR efficiencies 261 
across species ( Extended Data Figure 5a, Supplementary Figure 3 a, b), differences in 262 
the unmodified allele fraction most likely result from differences in repair fidelity. While 263 
small indels predominated in all species, we observed a marked inverse correlation 264 
between the frequency of large deletions and species lifespan, with the bowhead 265 
producing fewer  large deletions than human, cow, and mouse (Figure 3d-f) . When we 266 
assigned frequency -based percentile ranks from most negative to most positive indel 267 .

12 size (largest deletions to largest insertions), we observed a strong correlation between 268 
species lifespan and 5th percentile indel size, corresponding to large deletions 269 
(Pearson’s r=0.85, p=0.0009) ( Extended Data Figure 6). The results from these 270 
experiments suggest a greater efficiency and accuracy of DSB repair in the bowhead 271 
whale relative to humans and other mammals.  272 
CIRBP contributes to high DSB repair efficiency in the bowhead whale  273 
To identify mechanisms contributing to the efficiency and accuracy  of DSB repair in the 274 
bowhead whale, we measured and compared expression of DNA repair proteins in the 275 
bowhead to other mammalian species  by Western blot, quantitative MS proteomics, and 276 
RNA seq (Figure 4a , Extended Data Figure  7a-d). Bowhead cells show ed strikingly  277 
higher abundance of cold- inducible RNA -binding protein (CIRBP) than other 278 
mammalian species. (Figure 4 a, Extended Data Figure 7a, d). Levels of PARP1,  a 279 
functional partner of CIRBP during DNA repair41, were also increased relative to human. 280 
Unexpectedly, we found that levels of several important canonical NHEJ proteins (e.g. 281 
Ku70, Ku80, DNA -PKcs) are substantially higher in human cells than any other species 282 
tested  (Figure 4a , Extended Data Figure 7a).  283 
CIRBP is an RNA - and PAR -binding protein whose expression is induced by a variety of 284 
cellular stressors including cold shock, hypoxia, and UV irradiation41–44. It binds the 3’ 285 
UTR of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in cellular stress and DNA damage 286 
responses and promotes their stability and translation: known targets include ATR, 287 
RPA2, thioredoxin, and p2745–48. There is also evidence for a more direct role of CIRBP 288 
in DNA repair: PARP -1-dependent localization of CIRBP to sites of DNA damage 289 
promotes DSB repair and antagonizes micronucleus formation41. 290 .

13 To test whether CIRBP contributes to efficient NHEJ in bowhead whale cells, we 291 
overexpressed human (hCIRBP) and bowhead whale  (bwCIRBP ) in human NHEJ 292 
reporter cells. Overexpression of bwCIRBP, but not hCIRBP, enhanced NHEJ efficiency 293 
in human cells ~1.6- fold (p=0.002)  and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts ~3 -fold (Figure 294 
4b, Extended Data  Figure  8a). Overexpression of bwCIRBP , but not hCIRBP, also 295 
increased HR  efficiency in human cells ~2- fold (Figure 4c , e). Conversely, CIRBP 296 
depletion in bowhead whale cells by siRNA significantly reduced NHEJ efficiency 297 
(p=0.032) (Figure 4 d, e). Consistent with published observations, overexpression of 298 
bwCIRBP with nine arginines in the repeated RGG motif mutated to  alanine (9R/A), 299 
which impairs CIRBP’s ability to bind to PAR- polymers41, failed to stimulate HR and 300 
reduced stimulation of NHEJ (Figure 4 b, c, e ). To test the effects of bwCIRBP 301 
overexpression on chromosomal stability, we  quantified formation  of micronuclei in 302 
human cells after γ-irradiation . We found that overexpression of bwCIRBP  significantly 303 
decreased the percentage of cells with micronuclei, reflecting  an improvement in 304 
genomic stability (Figure 4f ).  305 
Surprisingly, we observed during our experiments that CIRBP protein abundance in the 306 
bowhead remained high regardless of whether cells were cultured at 37°C , 33°C , or 307 
lower temperatures  (the core body temperature of the bowhead has been measured at 308 
33.8°C)49,50, suggesting constitutive expression in contrast to its strong temperat ure 309 
dependence in other mammals (Extended Data Figure 8b)42. At no  temperature did 310 
human cells produce similarly high CIRBP levels.   In contrast, RNA -seq analysis 311 
(verified by qPCR) showed nearly identical CIRBP transcript levels between human and 312 
bowhead whale fibroblasts (Extended Data Figure 7b, 8c). The discrepancy between 313 .

14 mRNA and protein levels in tested species agrees with previous findings of CIRBP 314 
regulation at the post -transcriptional level51,52 .  315 
The human and bowhead CIRBP proteins differ by only 5 C- terminal amino acids 316 
(Extended Data Figure 9a, b ). Substitution  of these 5 codons in hCIRBP with bowhead 317 
codons increased protein expression, while mutation of bwCIRBP with the 5 hCIRBP  318 
codons decreased it  (Extended Data Figure 9c ). This was not accompanied by changes 319 
in mRNA transcript levels, consistent with post -transcriptional  regulation ( Extended Data 320 
Figure 9d) . Interestingly, although CIRBP abundance increased following introduction of 321 
the 5 bowhead substitutions  to hCIRBP,  it did not achieve the expression of  bowhead 322 
CIRBP, suggesting that synonymous changes to  the mRNA coding sequence contribute 323 
to higher translation efficiency of bowhead whale CIRBP.  Consistent with this notion, 324 
bwCIRBP has a higher codon adaptation index (CAI)53 than hCIRBP ; this difference 325 
remains after introduction of the five reciprocal mutations ( Extended Data Figure 9e).  326 
To test whether a hypothermia- mediated increase in human CIRBP can also affect DSB 327 
repair efficiency, we kept human cells for two days at 33°C before transfection with 328 
NHEJ reporter plasmid pre- digested with I -Sce-1. Indeed, cells exposed to hypothermia 329 
showed a ~2- fold (p=0.0017) increase in NHEJ efficiency (Figure 4g).   330 
Mechanisms of bowhead whale DNA repair fidelity  331 
LC-MS proteomics data and Western blot s with multiple antibodies  suggested increased 332 
abundance of  the single- stranded DNA binding protein RPA2 in the bowhead whale 333 
(Figure 4a , Extended Data Figure 7a, c). This was paralleled by elevated RPA2 334 
transcript abundance (Extended Data Figure 7b).  RPA is a conserved heterotrimeric 335 .

15 ssDNA -binding protein complex required for eukaryotic DNA replication, which plays a 336 
critical role in DNA repair and DNA damage signaling54,55. RPA deficiency increases the 337 
frequency of DSBs  under both basal56 and stressed57 conditions. Conversely, RPA 338 
overexpression increases resistance to genotoxic insults57–60. RPA promotes NHEJ  in 339 
vitro61, can protect ssDNA overhangs at Ku- bound DSBs62,63, and antagonizes 340 
microhomology -mediated end joining6448,49. 341 
It has previously been shown that RPA2 is an unstable protein highly prone to oxidative 342 
damage, and that the abundance of this subunit affects the abundance of RPA1 and 343 
RPA365,66. We therefore sought to determine whether the high abundance of RPA2 in 344 
bowhead whale cells may contribute to DNA repair fidelity. Because RPA is required for 345 
cell viability, and can cause toxicity when not expressed with appropriate subunit 346 
stoichiometry67, we selected methods aimed at transiently increasing or decreasing 347 
RPA activity in the period surrounding break induction to specifically isolate effects on 348 
DSB repair fidelity. Treatment of cells transfected with CRISPR to induce DSBs  with the 349 
small- molecule RPA DNA -binding inhibitor TDRL- 50568 significantly increased indel 350 
rates in both bowhead and human fibroblasts (Figure 5a, b ). In bowhead, RPA inhibition 351 
also increased the frequency of larger deletions, although this difference did not reach 352 
significance (Figure 5 b). Conversely, co- transfection of trimeric recombinant human 353 
RPA protein during CRISPR significantly decreased the frequency of mutated alleles in 354 
human cells without affecting CRISPR RNP transfection efficiency (Figure 5 a, 355 
Supplementary Figure 3c ). We additionally tested the effect of bwCIRBP 356 
overexpression on repair fidelity in human cells  and observed a modest but significant 357 
reduction in indel rates (Figure 5c). These results support the notion that variations in 358 .

stability in the bowhead whale.  360 
 361 
Discussion  362 
By studying a mammal capable of maintaining its health and avoiding death from cancer 363 
for over 2 centuries, we are offered a unique glimpse behind the curtain of a global 364 
evolutionary experiment that tested more mechanisms affecting cancer and aging than 365 
humans could ever hope to approach. Thr ough experiments using primary fibroblasts 366 
from the bowhead whale, we e xperimentally determined genetic  requirements for 367 
oncogenic transformation in the world’s longest  living mammal, an d provide evidence 368 
that additional tumor suppressors are not t he only solution to Peto’s Paradox. Instead, 369 
we find  that the bowhead whale solution lies  upstream of tumor suppressor loss , and is 370 
defined by  a capacity for highly accurate DNA DSB repair . We also present evidence 371 
that two proteins, RPA2 and CIRBP, are highly expressed in the bowhead relative to 372 
other mammals  and contribute to more efficient and accurate DSB repair .  373 
When cells experience DNA breaks, they are faced with a choice between several 374 
different fates, which cooperate to balance short -term risks to organismal viability with 375 
the long- term risks of genome instability.  One option is resolution of the DNA damage 376 
response and resumption of cell function. While  an unrepaired DSB is sufficient to kill a 377 
cell, an inaccurately repaired DSB can give rise to a cancer that kills the entire 378 
organism. The magnitude of this threat is reflected in the diversity of checkpoint 379 
mechanisms mammals have evolved to arrest or el iminate cells with DNA damage.  380 .

17 Thus, persistent or excessive damage signaling can trigger  a second category of DNA 381 
damage outcomes:  apoptosis or senescence.  382 
Prompt and efficient DSB repair promotes the survival and continued function of 383 
somatic cells. Ideally, this results in faithful restoration of the original genomic 384 
sequence.  However, aberrant outcomes such as loss of chromosome fragments (e.g. 385 
micronuclei), chromosomal rearrangements, or large deletions cause massive changes 386 
to the original DNA sequence69. These forms of genome instability are hallmarks of 387 
cancer and core drivers of malignant transformation. In quiescent cell populations, there 388 
is increased  potential for accumulation of persistent unrepaired DSBs. Efficient repair of 389 
DSBs i s particularly important for permanently post -mitotic cells like neurons  and 390 
cardiomyocytes , which often  are not replaced after cell death. Ultimately , the value of 391 
DSB repair to an organism ’s survival  is a function of both accuracy and efficiency. Upon 392 
excessive damage, i t is often better for organismal survival and longevity to eliminate 393 
cells at risk of genomic instability  through apoptosis or  senescence. 394 
Senescence is an important mechanism to control cells with potential genome instability 395 
through permanent growth arrest. Telomere shortening functions to induce senescence 396 
by limiting the number of times a cell can replicate. This mechanism appears to be 397 
functional in bowhead whale fibroblasts , in line with the theory  that telomere shortening 398 
is prevalent as a cancer -prevention mechanism in large- bodied mammals70. An 399 
additional such mechanism was recently reported for the bowhead whale in the form of 400 
a CDKN2C checkpoint gene duplication71. Senescence in general appears to represent 401 
a tradeoff between cancer and other forms of age- related dysfunction. There is 402 
substantial  evidence for harmful paracrine effects of senescence through the pro- 403 .

18 inflammatory SASP72. Here we demonstrate that bowhead whale has reduced 404 
inflammatory components of the SASP, which  could reduce the negative impact  of 405 
senescence. 406 
Like senescence, apoptosis is an efficient and critical mechanism to reduce the number 407 
of cells with dangerous levels of genome instability. Its importance as a cancer 408 
prevention mechanism is evident from the prevalence of p53 mutations in cancer73 and 409 
supported by findings of enhanced p53 function in the elephant3–5. However, high rates 410 
of apoptosis are likely to accelerate age- related decline through permanent cell loss74, 411 
especially in post -mitotic and irreplaceable cell populations in tissues such as brain and 412 
heart. Because excessive cell death or arrest is incompatible with organismal survival, 413 
baseline  levels of  DNA damage must be repaired. Given that most cells in mammalian 414 
bodies experience multiple endogenous DSBs per day75, faithful repair of th ese breaks 415 
is critical.  416 
Why might the bowhead whale  have evolved improved DNA repair, as opposed to the 417 
increased tumor suppressor copy number and elevated apoptotic response found in the 418 
elephant  and often proposed as a solution to Peto’s Paradox? One possible explanation 419 
is that tumor suppressors, apoptosis, and senescence all appear to pose costs to the 420 
organism and represent tradeoffs between cancer and stem cell depletion leading to 421 
age-related degeneration. Simply shifting the balance from apoptosis/senescence to 422 
survival and repair  could  be detrimental if not also coupled with increased fidelity, as 423 
evidenced by  the frequent  upregulation of DNA repair pathways in cancer cells76. 424 
However, evolutionary improvements that couple high efficiency with high fidelity , as 425 
found in the bowhead whale,  would promote long- term tissue function and maintenance 426 .

19 at both the cellular and genomic level s. Efficient repair could reduce loss of valuable 427 
post-mitotic cells with age and reduce mutations  in dividing cells. Maintenance of 428 
genome stability would  reduce cancer risk and - as suggested by a rapidly growing body 429 
of evidence  implicating  age-related somatic mosaicism as  a ubiquitous feature and 430 
functional driver of aging77–81- likely also protect against numerous other aspects of age- 431 
related decline. Thus , the lower accuracy and efficiency of DSB repair observed in 432 
mammals with shorter lifespans may simply reflect an absence of sufficient selective 433 
pressure. One potential drawback of a  very accurate DNA repair system is a reduction 434 
in diversity and slower rate of evolution of new traits. However, species living in safe 435 
and stable environments have no evolutionary pressure to rapidly evolve new 436 
adaptations. Interestingly , genome analysis of long- lived rock fishes living in deep ocean 437 
revealed positive selection in DNA repair  pathways82. 438 
The evolution of constitutively high CIRBP expression in the bowhead whale is likely to 439 
have been driven, at least in part , by the unique physiological stresses this Arctic 440 
cetacean must endure. This naturally  includes the extremely cold water in which it is 441 
constantly immersed, but also the ischemia/reperfusion- like fluctuations in tissue 442 
oxygen concentrations experienced by diving mammals83. 443 
Interestingly, beneficial effects of cold as a therapeutic agent have been known for a 444 
long time with brief cold-water immersion believed to promote health and hardening in 445 
Nordic cultures. Currently, whole body cryotherapy is widely used in sports medicine to 446 
reduce inflammation and facilitate recovery after exercise or injury84. While molecular  447 
mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of cryotherapy  are largely unknown,  448 .

20 we speculate that increased CIRBP expression may contribute to  health benefits by 449 
facilitating DNA repair.  450 
Cold showers provide a mild and transient reduction in body temperature, whereas 451 
artificial reduction of body temperature, or therapeutic hypothermia, is used clinically 452 
during surgery85. Interestingly, recovery from therapeutic hypothermia is compromised 453 
in CIRBP -KO rats and improved in rats with transgenic CIRBP overexpression86. Similar 454 
protective effects of CIRBP during hypothermia have been reported in brain87, kidney88 455 
intestine89, and cold-preserved hearts90. Given the dramatically enhanced protein 456 
production driven by bwCIRBP and hCIRBP mutants, local delivery of such  CIRBP 457 
variants (e.  g. through mRNA/DNA vector injection) could hold promise as strategies to 458 
improve tissue recovery from surgery or organ transplant.  459 
There are current ly no approved therapeutics  which aim to bolster DNA repair for the 460 
prevention of cancer or age- related decline, and it has been suggested that DNA repair 461 
would be difficult or impossible to improve91. However, the bowhead whale provides 462 
evidence that this notion is incorrect. Therapeutics based on increasing the activity or 463 
abundance of proteins like CIRBP or RPA2 could one day enable the treat ment of 464 
genome instability as a modifiable disease risk factor . 465

serum (GIBCO), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (GIBCO). All 516 
primary cells were cultured at 37ºC with 5% CO 2 and 3% O 2 except bowhead whale 517 
cells, which were cultured at 33ºC with 5% CO 2 and 3% O 2 based on published field 518 
measurements of bowhead body temperature, which measured a core temperature of 519 
33.8 ºC  and a range of lower temperatures in muscle and peripheral tissue.49,50 Prior to 520 
beginning experiments with bowhead whale fibroblasts, optimal growth and viability 521 
conditions were empirically determined through testing of alternative temperatures, 522 
serum concentrations, and cell culture additives, with optimal culture medium found to 523 
be the same for bowhead and other species.  Following isolation, low population- 524 
doubli ng (PD) primary cultures were preserved in liquid nitrogen, and PD was 525 
continually tracked and recorded during subsequent use for experiments.  526 
Soft agar assay  527 
Fibroblast culture medium as described above was prepared at 2X concentration using 528 
2X EMEM (Lonz a). To prepare the bottom layer of agar plates, 2X medium was mixed 529 
with a sterile autoclaved solution of 1.2% Noble Agar (Difco) at a 1:1 volumetric ratio, 530 
and 3 mL of 1X medium/0.6% agar was pipetted into each 6- cm cell culture dish and 531 .

24 allowed to solidify at room temperature in a tissue culture hood. To plate cells into the 532 
upper layer of soft agar, cells were harvested and washed, and immediately prior to 533 
plating were resuspended in 2X medium at 20,000 cells/1.5 mL and diluted twofold in 534 
0.8% Noble Agar  pre-equilibrated to 37°C. The cells in 0.4% agar/1X medium were 535 
pipetted gently to ensure a homogeneous single cell suspension, and 3 mL (20,000 536 
cells) per 6 cm dish were layered on top of the solidified lower layer. After solidifying in 537 
tissue culture hoods for 20 -30 min, additional medium was added to ensure the agar 538 
layers were submerged, and dishes were moved into cell culture incubators. Fresh 539 
medium was added onto the agar every 3 days. 4 weeks after plating, viable colonies 540 
were stained overnight with nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Thermo Fisher) as 541 
previously described.36 All cell lines were plated in triplicate.  542 
Mouse xenograft assay  543 
NIH-III nude mice (Crl:NIH -Lystbg-J Foxn1nuBtkxid) were purchased from Charles 544 
River Laboratories Inc. (Wilmington, MA, USA). Seven- week -old female mice were used 545 
to establish xenografts. For each injection, 2 × 106 cells were harvested and 546 
resuspended in 100 μl of ice- cold 20% matrigel (BD  Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in 547 
PBS (Gibco). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane gas, and 100 μl solution per 548 
injection was injected subcutaneously into the right and left flanks of each mouse with a 549 
22 gauge needle. 3 mice were injected bilaterally, for a total of 6 injections, per cell line 550 
tested. Tumor length and width were measured and recorded every 3- 4 days. Mice 551 
were euthanized after reaching a predetermined humane tumor burden endpoint of a 552 
maximum tumor dimension of 20mm in diameter, determined by the longest dimension 553 
of the mouse’s largest tumor. For mice that did not reach tumor burden endpoints, 554 .

25 experiments were terminated and mice euthanized after a maximum of 60 days. 555 
Euthanized mice were photographed and tumors were excised, photographed, and 556 
weighed to determine the mass of each tumor. Sections of each tumor were frozen at - 557 
80°C and preserved in formalin.  558 
Telomere lengths  559 
Telomere length was analyzed by Southern blot using the TRF method. Genomic DNA 560 
was extracted from cultured fibroblasts at different population doublings, digested with a 561 
mixture of AluI, HaeIII, RsaI, and HinfI restriction enzymes that do not cut within 562 
telomeric repeat sequences, separated using pulsed- field gel electrophoresis, and 563 
hybridized with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing telomeric sequence 564 
(TTAGGG) 4. Pulse d field gels were run using a CHEF -DR II apparatus (Bio- Rad) for 565 
22h at a constant 45 V, using ramped pulse times from 1 to 10 s.  566 
Telomeric repeat amplification protocol  567 
Telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay was performed using the TRAPeze kit 568 
(Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, in the 569 
first step of the TRAP assay, radiolabeled substrate oligonucleotide is added to 0.5 μg 570 
of protein extract. If telomerase is present and active, telomeric repeats (GGTTAG) are 571 
added to the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide. In the second step, extended products are 572 
amplified by PCR. Telomerase extends the oligonucleotide by multiples of 6 bp, 573 
generating a ladder of products of increasing length. A human cancer cell line 574 
overexpressing telomerase as well as rodent cells were used as a positive control.  575

26 CRISPR RNP complexes were formed in vitro by incubating Al t-R™ S.p.Cas9 Nuclease 577 
V3 (Integrated DNA technologies) with tracRNA annealed to target -specific crRNA 578 
(Integrated DNA Technologies) according to manufacturer instructions. For generation 579 
of tumor suppressor knockouts, 3 RNP complexes with crRNAs targeting different sites 580 
in a single target gene were combined and Alt -R Cas9 Electroporation Enhancer 581 
(Integrated DNA Technologies) was added to transfection mixes prior to electroporation. 582 
For comparative analysis of repair fidelity, 3 μg of pmaxGFP plasmid (Lonza) was 583 
added to transfection mixes to monitor transfection efficiency. Cells were trypsinized 584 
and washed with PBS, and 1 x 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μL of NHDF 585 
Nucleofector Solution (Lonza). The cell suspension was then combined with the 586 
CRISPR tr ansfection solution and gently mixed prior to electroporation on an Amaxa 587 
Nucleofector 2b (Lonza) using program U -23. For RPA inhibition, human and bowhead 588 
fibroblasts were treated with 50 uM TDRL- 505 (Sigma) (diluted 1000x into culture 589 
medium from 50mM stock solution in DMSO) for 3 hours prior to CRISPR transfection 590 
and kept in medium with 50 uM TDRL- 505 for 18 hours after transfection. For RPA co- 591 
transfection, 1 μg of recombinant human RPA heterotrimer (Enzymax) was added to 592 
CRISPR transfection solution immediately prior to electroporation.  593 
Isolation of clonal cell colonies and screening for tumor suppressor knockout  594 
Following CRISPR transfection, cells were plated at low density in 15- cm dishes to 595 
allow for the formation of isolated colonies. Once clonal colonies of sufficient size had 596 
formed, positions of well -isolated colonies were visually marked on the bottom of the 597 
cell culture dish while under a microscope using a marker. Dishes were aspirated and 598 
washed with PBS. Forceps were used to dip PYREX® 8x8 mm glass cloning cylinders 599 .

27 in adhesive Dow Corning® high- vacuum  silicone grease (Millipore Sigma) and one 600 
glass cylinder was secured to the dish over each marked colony. 150 µL of trypsin was 601 
added to each cylinder and returned to the incubator. When cells had rounded up from 602 
the plate, the trypsin in each cylinder was pipetted to detach cells and each colony was 603 
added to a separate well in a 6- cm culture dish containing culture medium. After 604 
colonies were expanded and split into 2 wells per colony, one well was harvested for 605 
Western blot screening for absence of target proteins, while the remaining well was kept 606 
for further experiments.  607 
Luciferase reporter assays for knockout verification  608 
For p53 activity measurement, 1 x 106 cells of control (WT) and clonally isolated p53 KO 609 
cell lines were electroporated with 3 µg p53 firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pp53- TA- 610 
Luc (Clontech/Takara) and 0.3 ug renilla luciferase control plasmid pRL- CMV 611 
(Promega) on an Amaxa Nucleofector 2b (Lonza). 24h later, cells were treated with 200 612 
uM etoposide (Sigma) to induce p53 activity. 24h following etoposide treatment, cells 613 
were harvested and luciferase activity of cell lysates was measured using the Dual - 614 
Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) in a GloMax 20/20 Luminometer 615 
(Promega) according to manufacturer instructions.  616 
For Rb activity measurement, 2 different reporters were tested in parallel: pE2F -TA-Luc 617 
(Clontech/Takara) to measure E2F transcriptional activity (repressed by Rb), and pRb- 618 
TA-Luc (Clontech/Takara) (promoter element directly suppressed by Rb). 1 x 106 cells 619 
of contro l (WT) and clonally isolated Rb KO cell lines were electroporated with 3 µg of 620 
either pE2F -TA-luc or pRb- TA-luc and 0.3 ug renilla luciferase plasmid on an Amaxa 621 
Nucleofector 2b (Lonza). Following transfection, cells were grown in complete medium 622 .

28 for 24h f ollowed by serum -free medium for 24h. Cells were then harvested and 623 
luciferase activity measured as described above.  624 
Next -generation sequencing of CRISPR repair products  625 
72h after transfection, cells were harvested and genomic DNA was isolated with the 626 
Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega). DNA concentration was measured on 627 
a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and 100 ng of DNA per sample was PCR -amplified with 628 
KAPA2G Robu st HotStart ReadyMix (Roche) based on findings of low PCR bias for 629 
KAPA polymerase9394. Primers targeted a conserved region surrounding  PTEN  exon 1 630 
(Extended Data Figure 4a). PCR was performed according to manufacturer instructions, 631 
with an annealing temperature of 66°C for 30 cycles. To purify samples for next - 632 
generation sequencing, PCR products were electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel 633 
and post -stained with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Thermo Fisher). Gels were 634 
visualized on a blue light tray (BioRad) to minimize damage to DNA. A gel slice for each 635 
lane was excised using a scalpel, and each slice was cut to include the region ranging 636 
from just above the prominent PTEN  PCR band down to and including the “primer 637 
dimer” region to ensure inclusion of  any deletion alleles. DNA was extracted from gel 638 
slices using the QiaQuick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and triplicate PCR reaction 639 
eluates per sample were pooled for sequencing. Sample concentrations were measured 640 
by Nanodrop and adjusted as necessary prior to submission for 2x250 bp paired- end 641

29 FASTQ files from each sequenced sample were analyzed with both CRISPResso2,95 644 
which uses an alignment -based algorithm, and CRISPRPic ,96 which uses a  kmer- based 645 
algorithm. CRISPResso2 was run using the following parameters: window size = 30, 646 
maximum paired- end overlap = 500, bp excluded from left and right ends = 15, 647 
minimum alignment score = 50, minimum identity score = 50, plot window size = 20. For 648 
CRISPRPic analysis, SeqPrep97 was used to merge overlapping read pairs and trim 649 
adapter sequences.  CRISPRPic was run on merged FASTQ sequences for each 650 
sample with the following parameters: index size = 8, window size = 30.  651 
HPRT mutation assay  652 
For the HPRT mutation assay, cells used were low -passage primary dermal fibroblasts 653 
from multiple species that were known to originate from male animals, to ensure single 654 
copy -number of the X -linked HPRT  gene. Each species was tested with 3 different cell 655 
lines from 3 individual animals. The bowhead HPRT  coding sequence was BLASTed 656 
against bowhead genome scaffolds16 and neighboring gene sequences were analyzed 657 
to confirm mammal -typical localization of  HPRT  on the bowhead X -chromosome. Cells 658 
were cultured in standard fibroblast growth medium, but with FBS being replaced with 659 
dialyzed FBS (Omega Scientific, Inc.) and supplemented with Fibroblast Growth Kit 660 
Serum -Free (Lonza) to improve growth and viability in dialyzed FBS. Dialyzed FBS was 661 
found in optimizat ion experiments to be necessary for efficient 6- thioguanine selection. 662 
Prior to mutagenesis, cells were cultured for 7 days in medium containing HAT 663 
Supplement (Gibco) followed by 4 days in HT Supplement (Gibco) to eliminate any pre- 664 
existing HPRT mutants. To induce mutation, cells were incubated for 3 hours in serum - 665 
free MEM containing 150 µg/mL N -ethyl -N-nitrosourea (ENU) (Sigma). Cells were then 666 .

30 maintained in ENU -free medium for 9 days to allow mutations to establish and existing 667 
HPRT to degrade. 1 x 106 cells from each cell line were harvested and plated in 668 
dialyzed FBS medium containing 5 µg/mL 6- thioguanine (Chem -Impex), in parallel with 669 
1 x 106 untreated control cells for each cell line. Cells were plated at a density of 1 x 105 670 
cells per 15- cm dish to  allow for efficient selection and colony separation, and to prevent 671 
potential ”metabolic cooperation“37. In tandem, for each cell line 200 cells from 672 
untreated and control conditions were plated in triplicate 10- cm dishes in non- selective 673 
medium to calculate plating efficiency. After 3 weeks of growth, surviving colonies were 674 
fixed and stained with a crystal violet/glutaraldehyde solution as previously described98. 675 
Colonies were counted, and HPRT mutation rate was calculated as plating-efficiency 676 
adjusted number of HPRT -negative colonies containing >50 cells. Appropriate 677 
concentrations of ENU and 6- TG, as well as optimal plating densities and growth 678 
conditions, were determined prior to the experiment described above through 679 
optimization and dose tit ration experiments.  680 
Digital droplet PCR measurement of CRISPR cleavage rate  681 
A ddPCR assay similar to a previously published method99 was used for time- course 682 
quantification of CRISPR DSB induction across species. qPCR primers at conserved 683 
sites flanking the guide RNA target site in the PTEN  gene were designed such that 684 
cleavage would prevent PCR amplification. As an internal copy number  reference 685 
control, a second set of previously validated qPCR primers targeting an ultraconserved 686 
element present in all mammals as a single copy per genome (UCE.359) was designed 687 
based on published sequences100. To allow for multiplexing and copy number  688

31 (FAM for PTEN  and HEX for UCE.359) targeting conserved sequences were designed, 690 
with 3‘ Iowa Black® and internal ZEN ™ quenchers (Integrated DNA Technologies). All 691 
primers a nd probes were checked for specificity by BLAST against each species’ 692 
genome.100  Fibroblasts were transfected with  PTEN  CRISPR RNP as described in 693 
“Next -generation sequencing of CRISPR repair products” and returned to cell culture 694 
incubators. At the indicated times post -transfection, cells were harvested, flash frozen, 695 
and genomic DNA was isolated with the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit 696 
(Promega). During isolation, newly lysed cells were treated with Proteinase K and 697 
RNase A for 30 minutes each at 37°C to minimize the possibility of residual CRISPR 698 
RNP activity. DNA concentration was measured on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer, and 699 
genomic DNA was pre -digested with BamHI -HF (NEB) and XhoI (NEB), which do not 700 
cut within target amplicons, to maximize PCR efficiency and distribution across droplets. 701 
15 ng of genomic DNA per sample was added to duplicate PCR reactions using the 702 
ddPCR ™ Supermix for Probes (No dUTP) master mix (Bio- Rad). Droplets were 703 
prepared and measured according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, each 20 µL 704 
reaction was mixed with 70 µL Droplet Generation Oil for Probes (Bio- Rad) and droplets 705 
were formed in a QX100 Droplet Generator (Bio- Rad). 40 µL of droplets per reaction 706 
were transferred to 96- well PCR plates and sealed with a PX1 PCR  Plate Sealer (Bio- 707 
Rad). The sealed plates were then subjected to PCR using a pre- optimized cycling 708 
protocol. Following PCR, the plates were loaded into a QX100™ Droplet Reader (Bio- 709 
Rad) and each droplet measured on both FAM and HEX channels. PTEN copy num ber 710 
normalized to UCE.359 reference copy number within each well was determined with 711

32 transfected control samples were adjusted as necessary to compensate for differences 713 
in multiplex PCR efficiency/specificity and “rain” droplets between species and bring 714 
normalized PTEN  copy number closer to 1. The control gates were then applied across 715 
all samples/time points within the same species and used for PTEN copy number 716 
calculation.  717 
Flow cytometric measurement of CRISPR RNP transfection efficiency  718 
CRISPR RNP transfections were performed as described above, but with ATTO -550 719 
fluorescently -labeled tracRNA (Integrated DNA Technologies). At 0h and 24h post - 720 
transfection, cells were harvested, pelleted, and analyzed by flow cytometry on a 721 
CytoFlex S Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Gain and ATTO -550 positive gates 722 
were set based on mock -transfected control cells included in each experiment.  723 
Senescence- associated β -galactosidase (SA -β-gal) staining 724 
 SA-β-gal staining was performed as previously described.101,102 Cells were washed 725 
twice with PBS and fixed in a solution containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% 726

CytoFlex S flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).  736 
p53 activity  737 
To test p53 activity in cultured primary fibroblasts, 150,000 cells were seeded in 6- well 738 
plates 1 day before transfection with 1 μg pp53- TA-Luc vector (Clontech) and 0.015 μg 739 
pRL-CMV -Renilla (Prom ega) to normalize for transfection efficiency. Transfections were 740 
performed using PEI MAX Transfection Grade Linear Polyethylenimine Hydrochloride 741 
(MW 40,000) (Polysciences) according to manufactur er instructions. 24h after 742 
transfections cells were lysed using 50μl passive lysis buffer (Promega) per 105 cells 743 
and flash frozen/thawed two times in liquid nitrogen and a 37°C water bath. Luciferase 744 
assays were performed using the Dual -Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) 745

Generation of NHEJ and HR reporter cell lines  748 
NHEJ and HR reporter constructs 38 were digested with NheI  restriction enzyme and 749 
purified with the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). The same plasmid DNA 750 
preparation was used for generating all reporter cell lines of the studied species.  Cells 751 
PD < 15 were recovered from liquid nitrogen and passaged once before the integration 752 
of the constructs. 0.25 µg of linearized NHEJ and HR constructs were electroporated 753 
into one million cells for each cell line. Two days after transfection, media was 754 
refreshed, and G418 was applied to select stable integrant clones. Tri plicates of each 755 .

34 reporter in each cell line were prepared to obtain an adequate number of stable clones. 756 
Clones from triplicate plates were pooled to get at least 50 clones per reporter per cell 757 
line.  758 
DSB repair assays and flow cytometry analysis  759 
DSB repa ir assays were performed as previously described103. Briefly, growing cells 760 
were co- transfected with 3 µg of plasmid encoding I -SceI endonuclease and 0.03 µg of 761 
plasmid encoding DsRed. The same batch of I -SceI and DsRed mixture was used 762 
throughout all species to avoid batch- to-batch variation. To test the effect of CIRBP on 763 
DSB repair, 3 µg of CIRBP plasmids were co -transfected with I -SceI and DsRed 764 
plasmids. Three days after transfection, the numbers of GFP+ and DsRed+ cells were 765 
determined by flow cytometry on a CytoFlex S Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter). For 766 
gating strategy see Supplementary Figure 4 in Supplementary Information. For each 767 
sample, a minimum of 50,000 cells w as analyzed. DSB repair efficiency was calcul ated 768 
by dividing the number of GFP+ cells by the number of DsRed+ cells.  769 
For knockdown experiments, bowhead whale cells containing the NHEJ reporter were 770 
transfected with 120 pmol of anti -bwCIRBP or control siRNAs (Dharmacon) 3 days 771 
before I -Sce1/DsRed transfections using an Amaxa Nucleofector (U -023 program). The 772 
efficiency of knockdown was determined by Western blot.  773 
For the extrachromosomal assay and fidelity analysis, NHEJ reporter plasmid was 774

transfection control. 72h after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow 779 
cytometry on a BD LSR II instrument. At least 20,000 cells were collected for each 780 
sample. Immediately after FACS, genomic DNA was isolated from cells us ing the 781 
QIAGEN  Blood  & Tissue kit. DSB repair sites in the NHEJ construct were amplified by 782 
PCR using Phusion polymerase (NEB), cloned using the TOPO Blunt cloning kit (NEB) , 783 
and sent for Sanger sequencing. At least 100 sequenced clones were aligned and 784 
analyzed using the ApE software.     785 
Western blotting 786 
All antibodies were checked for conservation of the target epitope in the protein 787 
sequence of each included species, and only  those targeting regions conserved across 788 
these species were used. For a limited number of proteins  where the available 789 
antibodies with specific epitope information  disclosed did not target conserved regions , 790 
we selected antibodies based on demonstrated reactivity across a broad range of 791 
mammal species and always confirmed these results with multiple antibodies.  792 
Information on antibodies is provided in Supplementary Methods.  793 
Exponentially growing cells were harvested with trypsin and counted, and 106 cells were 794 
resuspended in 100 µL of PBS containing protease inhibitors. 100µL of 2x Laemmli 795 
buffer (Bio- Rad) was added, and samples were boiled at 95ºC for 10 minutes. Samples 796 
were separated with 4- 20% gradient SDS -PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, 797 
and blocked in 5% milk -TBS-T for 2 hours at room temperature. Membranes were 798 
incubated overnight at +4ºC with primary antibodies in 5% milk -TBS-T. After 3 washes 799 
for 10 minutes with TBS -T, membranes were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature 800 .

36 with secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP  or a fluorophore . After 3 washes with 801 
TBS-T signal was developed for HRP secondaries with Clarity Western ECL Substrate 802 
(Bio-Rad). CIRBP and RPA2 expression were each  measured with 3 different 803 
antibodies targeting conserved epitopes ( Extended Data Figure 7c, d ). 804 
PARP activity  805 
PARP activity was measured in cell nuclear extracts with the PARP Universal 806 
Colorimetric Assay Kit (Trevigen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear 807 
extracts were prepared using EpiQuik Nuclear Extraction Kit (EpigenTek) following 808 
manufacturer  protocol. 2.5µg of total nuclear extract was added to measure PARP 809 
activity. 810 
For measurement of PARylation efficiency, cells were treated with 400µM H 2O2 for 15 811 
and 30 min. At the end of incubation, cells were placed on ice, washed once with PBS , 812 
and lysed directly on a plate with 2x Laemmli  buffer. Samples were boiled for 10min at 813 
95ºC and processed by Western Blot.   814 
Pulsed -field gel electrophoresis and analysis of DSBs  815 
After irradiation and repair incubation, confluent human and bowhead whale skin 816 
fibroblasts were harvested, ~400,000  cells were resuspended in PBS, mixed with an 817 
equal volume of 1.4% low gelling temperature agarose and embedded into agarose 818 
plugs. Plugs were kept for 1h at +4ºC and incubated in lysis solution 1 (0.5M EDTA, 2% 819 
sodium sarcosine, 0.5 mg/ml Proteinase K) for 24h at +4ºC. Subsequently plugs were 820 
placed into lysis solution 2 (1.85M NaCl, 0.15M KCl, 5mM MgCl 2, 2mM EDTA, 4mM Tris 821 
pH 7.5, 0.5% TritonX100) for 40h at +4ºC. Plugs were then washed two times for 1h in 822 .

37 TE buffer and stored in TE buffer at +4ºC. PFGE was carried out with a CHEF DRII 823 
system (Bio -Rad) in 0.8% agarose gels. The gels were run at 14°C with linearly 824 
increasing pulse times from 50 to 5,000 s for 66 h at a field strength of 1.5 V/cm. Gels 825 
were stained with 0.5mg/ml ethidium bromide for 4h, washed with TBE buffer and 826 
imaged. Quantitative analysis was performed with Image Lab software (Bio- Rad). The 827 
fraction of DNA entering the gel was quantified. Samples irradiated with various doses 828 
and not incubated for repair served as a calibration to determine the percentage of 829 
remaining DSBs in the repair samples from the fraction of DNA entering the gel.   830 
Construction of lentiviral overexpression vectors and lentivir us production  831 
The coding sequence of bwCIRBP  was amplified by PCR using Phusion polymerase 832 
(NEB),  digested with EcoRI and NotI, and cloned in between EcoRI and NotI sites of the 833 
Lego- iC2 plasmid. The sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing.  834 
Lentiviral particles were produced in Lenti -X 293T cell s (Takara). Approximately 10x106 835 
cells were transfected with a mixture of pVSV -G (1.7 µg ), psPAX2 (3.4 µg ) and Lego- 836 
iC2-bwCIRBP (6.8 µg) using PEI MAX (Polysciences) . The day  after transfection, 837 
DMEM culture medium (ThermoFisher) was replaced with fresh medium and lentiviral 838 
particles were harvested from the supernatant for the next 3 days.  839 
Quantification of micronuclei  840 
Two different  approaches were used. To analyze binucleated cells containing 841 
micronuclei (MN), 20 ,000 cells were  plated per chamber slide 2d before ionizing 842 
radiation. Immediately after irradiation (for human cells) or 2d after irradiation (for 843 
bowhead whale cells), cytochalasin B was added to cell culture media at a final 844 .

38 concentration 0.5 µg/ml, and cells were incubated for an additional 72h. At the end of 845 
incubation, cells were washed with PBS, incubated in 75mM KCl for 10min at RT, fixed 846 
with ice -cold methanol for 1.5 min, air -dried, and stored. Immediately before the 847 
analysis, cells were stained with 100 µg/ml acridine orange for 2min, washed with PBS, 848 
mounted in PBS and analyzed by  fluorescen ce microscopy. At least 1000 binucleated 849 
cells were analyzed per sample.  850 
For analysis of MN in single cells overexpressing bwCIRBP, exponentially growing cells 851 
were  transduced with LEGO -iC2-bwCIRBP lentivirus in the presence of 10 µg/ml  852 
polybrene. Two days after transduction, cells were passaged, and irradiated the 853 
following day. 3 days after irradiation, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 15 min, 854 
washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% TritonX100 for 2min, washed in PBS , and 855 
mounted in VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI. Cells were analyzed 856 
with a fluorescent microscope. At least 1000 cells were analyzed per condition.    857 
Host cell reactivation assay  858 
A host cell reactivation assay was used to measure the repair of UV -induced DNA 859 
damage through nucleotide excision repair as previously described.33  860 
To measure the repair of oxidative DNA damage (base excision repair), 20 µg of firefly 861 
luciferase (FFL) plasmid was mixed with 20- 200 µM methylene blue (MB), and water 862 
was added to a final volume of 0.4ml. DNA -MB mixture was dropped onto a petri dish 863 
and placed on ice. An additional petri dish containing water was placed on top. The 864 
DNA -MB mixture was exposed to visible light for 15 min using a 100W lamp at an 11cm 865 .

39 distance. Damaged DNA was purified, and the host cell reactivation assay was 866 
performed as des cribed for UV -induced DNA damage.    867 
Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) ELISA  868 
Human and bowhead whale skin fibroblasts were grown until they reached confluency 869 
before UVC radiation. Cells were irradiated in PBS at doses of 0, 5, 10, 20 and 30J/m2 870 
and harvested immediately for building an induction curve. To assess DNA repair, cells 871 
were irradiated at 30 J/m2 and incubated for 6, 24 and 48h before harvesting. Genomic 872 
DNA was isolated using QIAamp Blood Kit (Qiagen). Samples of DNA were diluted in 873 
PBS to a final concentration of 2 µg/ml, denatured at 100ºC for 10min and incubated in 874 
an ice bath for 15 min. 100 ng of denatured DNA solution was applied to ELISA plate 875 
wells precoated with protamine sulfate (Cosmo Bio) and dried O/N at 37ºC. Plates were 876 
washed five times with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween- 20 (PBS -T) and blocked 877 
in 2% FBS  in PBS-T for 30min at 37ºC. After 5 washes with PBS -T, plates were 878 
incubated with mouse monoclonal anti -CPD antibodies (Clone TDM -2, 1:1000) in PBS 879 
for 30 min at 37ºC . Plates were then sequentially incubated with goat -anti mouse biotin 880 
IgG (Invitrogen, 1:1000) and streptavidin- HRP (Invitrogen, 1:5000) in PBS for 30 min at 881 
37ºC each with 5 washes with PBS -T before and after incubations. Plates were washed 882 
with citrate b uffer and incubated with substrate solution (citrate buffer/o- 883 
phenylenediamine/hydrogen peroxide) for 30 min at 37ºC. Finally, the reaction was 884 
stopped with 2M H 2SO 4 and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm with a plate 885 
reader.  886

40 Identification of rare codons (<10% usage for the corresponding amino acid in human 888 
CDS sequences) was performed on CIRBP coding sequences using the Benchling 889 
Codon Optimization Tool .104 Codon adaptation index (CAI) was calculated w ith human 890 
codon frequencies using the E -CAI web server.53 891 
RNA isolation and RNA -seq analysis  892 
RNA from exponentially growing or senescent human and bowhead whale primary skin 893 
fibroblasts was isolated using the Quick -RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research) according 894 
to manufacturer instructions.  895 
The RNA -seq reads were first processed using Trim_Galore (version 0.6.6). Cleaned  896 
RNA -seq reads were used to quantify gene expression with Salmon (version 1.4.0).105 897 
Transcript FASTA files of species were from our published de novo transcriptome 898 
assemblies.106 Transcript FASTA files were indexed with the command “Salmon index” 899 
with default parameters. Cleaned RNA -seq reads were aligned to the indexed transcript 900 
with the specific parameters ( --useVBOpt --seqBias --gcBias), which were set for 901 
sequence- specific bi as correction and fragment GC bias correction. The read counts of 902 
genes obtained from Salmon were further normalized by trimmed mean of M -values 903 
(TMM)107 and median of ratios methods.108 904 
LC-MS proteomic analysis of fibroblasts  905 
2 15- cm dishes of growing primary fibroblasts from 2 cell lines for each species were 906 
harvested for protein. Cells were washed with PBS and pellets were snap frozen and 907 
stored in liquid nitrogen until processing. Cells were solubilized with 5% SDS; 50 mM 908 
TEAB pH 7, and sonicated at 8°C with 10x 45s pulses using 30% power with 15 s rest 909 .

41 between each pulse with a cup horn Q800R3 Sonicator System (Qsonica; Newtown 910 
CT). Soluble proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at 55°C, followed by 911 
alkylation with  15 mM iodoacetamide at 25°C in the dark for 30 min. S -trap micro 912 
columns (Protifi; Farmingdale, NY) were employed after this step for overnight tryptic 913 
digestion and peptide isolation according to manufacturer instructions. All solvents were 914 
MS-grade. Resulting tryptic peptides were resuspended in MS -grade water and were 915 
quantified using a Pierce™ Quantitative Fluorometric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher cat 916 
#23290). Prior to MS, peptides were mixed with a common internal retention time 917 
standards109 (CiRT) peptide mix (50 fmol CiRT/2ug total tryptic peptides) and 918 
acetonitrile (ACN) and formic acid were added to concentrations of 5% and 0.2% 919 
respectively. The final concentration of the peptide mix was 0.5µg/µl. 2ug (4ul) of each 920 
were resolved by nano -electros pray ionization on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos MS 921 
instrument (Thermo) in positive ion mode. A 30 cm home- made column packed with 1.8 922 
μm C -18 beads was employed to resolve the peptides. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid 923 
and solvent B was 80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid and flow rate was 300 nl/min.  924 
The length of the run was 3 h with a 155 min gradient from 10- 38% B.  HCD (30% 925 
collision energy) was used for MS2 fragmentation and dynamic exclusion was operative 926 
after a single time and lasted for 30s. Other details of the run parameters may be found 927 
in the embedded run report of the RAW data file uploaded to the ProteomeXchange 928 
database.  Peptide assignments and quantitation were done using the label -free quant 929 
match between runs (LFQ -MBR) workflow of MSFragger110– 112. MaxLFQ with a 930 
minimum of two ions was implemented and normalization was selected. Additional 931 
details are available in MSFragger log files. Searches were performed within the 932 .

Figure 3. The bowhead whale repairs DSBs with higher accuracy and efficiency than other mammals. a, NHEJ efficiency was measured using fluorescent reporter construct where GFP gene is interrupted by a “killer” exon flanked by I-SceI sites (Extended Data Figure 3a). DSB induction by I-SceI removes the exon and successful NHEJ event leads to reactivation of the GFP gene. NHEJ reporter construct was integrated into primary, low passage skin fibroblasts. NHEJ repair efficiency was assayed by transfecting cells with I-SceI expression vector and a DsRed plasmid as a transfection control. The repair efficiency was calculated as the ratio of GFP+/DsRed+ cells. Experiments were repeated at least 3 times for each cell line.  b, % binucleated cells containing micronuclei in human and bowhead whale fibroblasts after 2Gy 𝛾-irradiation.

(a-c) Data are averages from experiments performed in triplicate. Error bars represent SEM. * p<0.05, **** p<0.0001. All charts analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD.   d, Graphical summary. Bowhead whale has evolved very efficient and accurate DSB repair that is mediated by high protein levels of CIRBP, RPA2 and high PARP activity. This enhanced DNA repair may help bowhead whale achieve cancer resistance despite fewer mutational hits required for malignant transformation of whale cells as compared to human cells. The strategy of enhanced repair rather than enhanced elimination of damaged cells through apoptosis or senescence may benefit the extreme longevity of the bowhead whale.
