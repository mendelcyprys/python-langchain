The paper delves into the mechanisms behind DNA repair and anti-cancer properties in the bowhead whale, the longest-living mammal. It discusses the incongruity known as Peto's Paradox, where larger animals like the bowhead whale are less cancer-prone despite having more cells. The research focuses on the unique genetic adaptations in the bowhead whale that enable it to resist oncogenic transformation with fewer tumor suppressor genes. Notably, the study highlights the role of CIRBP and RPA2 proteins in enhancing DNA repair efficiency and maintaining genomic stability.

This paper investigates DNA repair mechanisms in the bowhead whale, focusing on its unique ability to live over 200 years without succumbing to cancer. The study reveals that despite its large size and long lifespan, the bowhead whale exhibits fewer genetic hits required for oncogenic transformation compared to human cells. Instead of relying on additional tumor suppressor genes, the whale emphasizes accurate and efficient DNA repair to maintain genome integrity. The research identifies two key proteins, CIRBP and RPA2, which play crucial roles in enhancing DNA repair efficiency and fidelity in bowhead whale cells.
